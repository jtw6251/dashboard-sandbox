Hi Luke! Welcome to our dashboard :D <br>
I have put a very basic page together for you to have a play around with!

### Instructions
1. Install python (version >= 3.7.*)
2. Clone this git repo to your local directory
3. Install the packages required by executing `pip install -r requirements.txt` (make sure you're in the folder that contains the `requirements.txt`)
4. To run the dashboard, execute `python app.py`
5. To view the dashboard, open up a browser and enter the url `http://127.0.0.1:8050/`
6. To stop the dashboard app from running, simply press `CTRL+C`
